For a list of available features, see [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/ACWW-Web-SaveEditor/blob/main/FeaturesList.md).

If you look for an on console Animal Crossing: Wild World Save Editor.. we'd suggest to look for [WildEdit](https://github.com/Universal-Team/WildEdit) (on a DS(i)) or [LeafEdit](https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit) (on a 3DS).
